## Specific Use Cases

1. Debugging a JavaFX integration issue
    - Used AI to help identify why `Tyrone` class was not being found across packages.
    - Confirmed missing imports and constructor mismatch were the cause.
    - Verified correct Gradle + JavaFX configuration steps.

2. Generating test case ideas
    - Used AI to suggest edge cases for testing command parsing.
    - Helped think through invalid input cases (e.g., missing index, malformed deadlines).
    - Used suggestions to manually create expected `.txt` output test cases.

## Notes

All code changes were reviewed and adjusted manually before being committed.
AI was used only for debugging guidance and test case brainstorming.
